# ELECTRICITY PRICE FORECASTING

## Goal 
Design a predictive algorithm that determines optimal energy feed-in timings for individual power producers, enabling investment banks to better assess the financial implications and market dynamics of increased decentralized energy contributions to the grid.

### SUGGESTED APPROACH 
●	Technology exploration
  o	Explore Transformer-based Timeseries predictions
  o	Find available datasources within Norwegian market
    ▪	Historical weather from met.no 
●	Project Specification 
  o	Define the requirements of the system.
●	System Architecture 
  o	Describe an overview of how a system can be built. 
●	Development of Minimum Viable Concept
