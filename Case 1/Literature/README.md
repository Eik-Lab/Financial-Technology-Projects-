## [Recent Advances in Electricity Price Forecasting](Case\n1/Literature/recent_advances_in_electricity_price_forecasting.pdf)

#### Abstract
Since the inception of competitive power markets two decades ago, electricity price forecasting (EPF) has gradually become a fundamental process for energy companies’ decision making mechanisms. Over the years, the bulk of research has concerned point predictions. However, the recent introduction of smart grids and renewable integration requirements has had the effect of increasing the uncertainty of future supply, demand and prices. Academics and practitioners alike have come to understand that probabilistic electricity price (and load) forecasting is now more important for energy systems planning and operations than ever before. With this paper we offer a tutorial review of probabilistic EPF and present much needed guidelines for the rigorous use of methods, measures and tests, in line with the paradigm of ‘maximizing sharpness subject to reliability’. The paper can be treated as an update and a further extension of the otherwise comprehensive EPF review of Weron [1] or as a standalone treatment of a fascinating and underdeveloped topic, that has a much broader reach than EPF itself.

## [A novel system for multi-step electricity price forecasting for electricity market management](Case\n1/Literature/recent_advances_in_electricity_price_forecasting.pdf)


#### Highlights
- A novel system was developed for electricity market management.

- It was found to be applicable in a real electricity market.

- The developed system adaptively adjusted, without needing any future information.

- A new algorithm named IMOSCA was developed to optimize the system.
