## Example 1 - Hourly Electricity Price Forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks

#### Abstract
This article focuses on electricity price forecasting and presents a state-of-the-art approach to solve it. The European electricity spot market has become more fluctuating due to the increasing share of renewable energy, which is bid at competitive prices and depends on non-deterministic factors like weather conditions. The analysis compares a trivial baseline model to an advanced time series forecasting technique called Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks. The aim is to develop a simple and modular code to train an LSTM using an open electricity price dataset and estimate its performance compared to a simple baseline model.
