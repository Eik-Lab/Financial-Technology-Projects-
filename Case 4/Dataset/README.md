# Dataset

## Indicators on firm level innovation activities from web scraped data

#### Dataset description

This dataset contains information on companies' innovative behavior measured at the firm level. It is based on web-scraped firm-level data derived from medium-high and high-technology companies in the European Union and the United Kingdom. The data are retrieved from individual company websites and include information on a total of 96,921 companies. The dataset provides information on various aspects of innovation, most significantly the research and development orientation of the company at both the company and product levels, the company’s collaborative activities, the company’s products, and the use of standards.

In addition to the web-scraped data, the dataset aggregates a variety of firm-level indicators, including patenting activities. In total, the dataset includes 28 variables with unique identifiers, which enable connections to other databases, such as financial data.
