# DATA-DRIVEN DECISIONS IN MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS
## BACKGROUND 
The merger and acquisition(M&A) market is continuously growing at a high pace. The worldwide market for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) has maintained a steady upward trend, with the total value of global M&A deals reaching $3.4 trillion in 2022  . However, it's important to note that despite these high transaction volumes, a significant percentage of M&As fail in enhancing shareholder value. In fact, the failure rates of M&As are quite high, fluctuating between 70% and 90%. In the search for innovation, high-value intellectual property, and associated brand value, many companies are turning to acquisitions to find assets that can assist them shifting the scope of a business. This especially of interest to keep up with the fast technology development which can lead to an increased resource uncertainty for the acquirers . To handle this increased uncertainty, data analytics has become a method increasingly used by the industry. The technical development of solutions based on artificial intelligence and analytics is continuously advancing, creating new opportunities which furthermore enables more informed decision-making. Generating new insights based on more objective information, which enables enhanced forecasting. 

## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
Data is available, but there are still opportunities on how to develop the tools for assessing available data. Much of the quantitative firm-level innovation research relies on structured data made available by either third-party organizations, surveys, or interviews. Datasets aim to capture innovation inputs (e.g. R&D expenditure) and to create practical indicators for measuring innovation outcomes (e.g. through patents). This case is based on using patent data in combination with other sources to develop a data-driven method for assessing mergers and acquisitions. 
To develop this method the following approach is suggested. 
•	Project Specification 
o	Identify - Indicators on firm level innovation activities 
	reference work  for finding datasets or metrics. 
	available tools  
	reference projects  

•	System Architecture 
o	Propose a conceptual structure of a possible web scraping solution. 

•	Development of Minimum Viable Concept 
o	Using Figma or Streamlit demonstrate how the system can be deployed.
