# CASE 6 - DATA-DRIVEN BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION
## BACKGROUND 
In the intricate world of investment banking, being able to assess the financial stability and potential risks associated with companies is of paramount importance. While traditional methods provide a myriad of metrics to analyze, synthesizing them into a single, digestible, and actionable score can significantly streamline the decision-making process for stakeholders. This concept is not foreign, as seen with ESG scores focusing on environmental, social, and governance factors. Drawing inspiration from such consolidated metrics, there's a growing demand for a similar, unified "Bankruptcy Score" to gauge a company's risk of insolvency.
The challenge is to conceptualize, design, and validate a comprehensive "Bankruptcy Score" – a single metric that accumulates a blend of financial, operational, and market-driven indicators to predict a company's risk of bankruptcy. This score should not only simplify the risk assessment process but also enhance its predictive accuracy.


## GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 
Develop your own Bankruptcy score method that presents key aspects such as 
*	Consolidation of Metrics: Identify, evaluate, and consolidate a range of traditional and alternative data sources into a singular score.
*	Dynamic Adaptability: Ensure the score is adjustable based on industry, geography, and size of the company, allowing for more tailored risk assessments.
*	Transparency & Interpretability: Make the methodology behind the score transparent and easily interpretable for stakeholders.
*	Validation & Reliability: Backtest the score with historical bankruptcy cases to validate its predictive power and reliability.

## SUGGESTED APPROACH 
In order to achieve this the following activities is suggested 
*	Technology exploration 
o	Explore available data sources. 
▪	Review of the “US Company Bankruptcy Prediction Dataset” and references projects on how machine learning can be used to predict bankruptcy.
*	Project Specification 
o	Define your own KPIs assessing various parameters of a company's health. 
*	Method - System Architecture 
o	Describe how data can be obtained, processed and aggregated, to keep your score up-to-date
*	Development of Minimum Viable Concept 
o	How can this data be presented? (ex. Figma description)
*	Suggested limitations 
o	The goal of this project could be proposing a method for predicting bankruptcy in a specific sector such as the financial sector such as larger financial institutions to regional banks in the US based on a knowledge transfer from this public available dataset.
